# Error Handling Implementation

This document describes the improved error handling implementation in the application.

## Overview

The application now has a more robust error handling system that provides a better user experience when errors occur. The implementation uses React Router's `errorElement` prop to catch errors at the route level and display a user-friendly error page.

## Components

### ErrorBoundary

The `ErrorBoundary` component (`src/components/error/ErrorBoundary.jsx`) has been enhanced to:

- Accept props for `hasError`, `error`, `errorInfo`, and `onReset`
- Update its state when props change
- Call the `onReset` prop when the reset button is clicked (if provided)
- Display a well-styled error message with the error details and stack trace

This allows the component to be used in two ways:
1. As a traditional error boundary (wrapping components to catch errors)
2. With props to directly display an error (for use with React Router's `errorElement`)

### ErrorPage

A new `ErrorPage` component (`src/pages/ErrorPage.jsx`) has been created to:

- Use React Router's `useRouteError` hook to get the error that occurred during route rendering
- Create an error info object similar to what `componentDidCatch` receives
- Use a wrapper component (`ErrorBoundaryWrapper`) to simulate an error boundary with pre-set error state
- Render the `ErrorBoundary` component with the error manually set

### Route Configuration

The route configuration (`src/routes/index.jsx`) has been updated to:

- Import the `ErrorPage` component
- Add the `errorElement` prop to the root route, using the `ErrorPage` component

## How It Works

1. When an error occurs anywhere in the application (including in components outside of an `ErrorBoundary`), React Router catches the error and renders the `ErrorPage` component.
2. The `ErrorPage` component gets the error using the `useRouteError` hook and passes it to the `ErrorBoundaryWrapper` component.
3. The `ErrorBoundaryWrapper` component creates a simulated error state and passes it to the `ErrorBoundary` component.
4. The `ErrorBoundary` component displays a user-friendly error message with the error details and stack trace.
5. When the user clicks the "다시 시도" (Try Again) button, the `handleReset` method is called, which navigates back to the previous page.

## Testing

To test the error handling:

1. Run the application
2. Click the "에러 발생" (Error Occurrence) button in the header
3. Observe that the error is caught and the `ErrorPage` component is rendered
4. Verify that the error message and stack trace are displayed correctly
5. Click the "다시 시도" (Try Again) button to navigate back to the previous page

## Benefits

This implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Better User Experience**: Users see a friendly error message instead of a generic error screen.
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Errors are caught at the route level, so even errors in components outside of an `ErrorBoundary` are handled.
3. **Detailed Error Information**: Developers can see the error message and stack trace, which helps with debugging.
4. **Easy Recovery**: Users can easily recover from errors by clicking the "다시 시도" (Try Again) button.

## Conclusion

The improved error handling implementation provides a more robust and user-friendly way to handle errors in the application. By using React Router's `errorElement` prop and enhancing the `ErrorBoundary` component, we've created a system that catches errors at the route level and displays a well-styled error page with detailed error information.
